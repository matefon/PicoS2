# PicoS2
## RPi Pico macro-keyboard project which uses a PS/2 keyboard's input to send keystrokes to the computer.

### IMPORTANT NOTES
The software is currently in heavy development, which means:
- the program can only read the PS/2 keys pressed and display them via UART
- I am working on USB HID with the help of the Git project [guruthree/pico-superkey-board](https://github.com/guruthree/pico-superkey-board)

Some info about PS/2 protocol: [hungarian](http://www.vfx.hu/info/atkeyboard.html), [english 1](https://www.avrfreaks.net/sites/default/files/PS2%20Keyboard.pdf), [english 2](https://karooza.net/how-to-interface-a-ps2-keyboard)

**I accept any help and suggestions.**

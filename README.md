# PicoS2
## RPi Pico macro-keyboard project which uses a PS/2 keyboard's input to send keystrokes to the computer.

### IMPORTANT NOTES
The software is currently in heavy development, which means:
- the program can only read the PS/2 keycodes and display them via UART
- trying to get the HID working with the help of the Git project [buildcomics/AHK_keyboard](https://github.com/buildcomics/AHK_keyboard), but I am facing compile errors
- messy code, will clean up.

### Also, this is my first C/C++ project, not just on the Pico, therefore I accept any help and suggestions.

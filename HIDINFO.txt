The 'AHK Scripts' folder and the following files were added from AHK_keyboard-1.0.0 project on GitHub to make HID keyboard work:
- control_leds.ahk (probably not needed for this project)
- main_hid.c (formerly main.c in its own dir)
- tusb_config.h
- usb_descriptors.c (also referred in CMakeLists.txt)
- usb_descriptors.h
